                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Poshmark is an existing application I was tasked to redesign. It is a mobile application where
                        users can either sell clothing they no longer wear or buy clothing at discounted prices. The
                        appeal of this application is users can buy high end brands, such as Zara and Madewell, at steep
                        discounts. Along with this, sellers can earn some supplemental income from selling what they
                        have in their closets.

                        Based on Poshmark’s designated function, to buy and sell used clothing, I asked five different
                        people to do two tasks. The first is to find three items they would like to own, and act as if
                        they were going to buy them. The second is to take an article of clothing in their closet and
                        put it up for sale. Based off of their experiences I came up with the following flaws and plan
                        on how to fix them.</p>

                    <h3>Flaws and Fixes</h3>
                    <p>Below is a list of the seven factors that define user experience and my thoughts on how the app
                        portrayed them:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Useful:</b> There are a multitude of apps out there similar to this one, and a lack of
                            usability
                            could cause this app to get lost among all the others.</li>
                        <li><b>Useable:</b> Somewhat usable. It can be difficult to specify what a user is looking for,
                            as well
                            as navigate other features, which could cause them to turn away from the app.</li>
                        <li><b>Findable:</b> This goes alongside usability. It can be troublesome to navigate through
                            the app
                            to find what you are looking for.</li>
                        <li><b>Credible:</b> There is a lack of credibility in this app, considering anyone can post
                            what they
                            please without restrictions.</li>
                        <li><b>Desireable:</b> I would say this app, as well as apps like this, are desirable as more
                            people
                            are leaning towards thrifting rather than supporting the fast fashion industry.</li>
                        <li><b>Accessible:</b> I am uncertain how accessible this app is. I couldn’t find any settings
                            to make
                            it easier for people with disabilities to be able to navigate.</li>
                        <li><b>Valuable:</b> The premise of the app is valuable. However, like I said with usability,
                            there are
                            many other apps that can provide the same service that have better design.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As for aspects of information architecture this app contains, I found Poshmark lacking in both
                        navigation and organization. I found the app as a whole difficult to navigate. I also found
                        labelling to be off, redundancies in the app, and a lack of functional grouping. Moving forward
                        I had two goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve Navigation</li>
                        <li>Declutter and remove redundancies</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <h4>Testing Round One:</h4>
                    <p>I interviewed five different users, tasking them with two goals.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Buy an article of clothing</li>
                        <li>Post and item to sell</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After conducting the interviews I came up with the following changes to the prototype:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proceed to checkout button needs to be more prominent and stand out to the user.</li>
                        <li>Add payment options at checkout.</li>
                        <li>Add continue shopping button on add to cart page.</li>
                        <li>Add a way to customize search criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>
                        Testing Round Two:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The second round of user testing had the same goals as the previous round. In this redesign, I
                        addressed the main issues the previous users brought forward, and no new issues were brought to
                        my attention. I felt I had developed a solid redesign at this point based on the positive
                        feedback from the users.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaway</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The design process doesn't end after development is completed.</b>Even the most well
                            known apps can benefit from continued improvment. It is important to continue to listen to
                            the application's users to create a more positive experience.</li>
                            <li><b>Revolving the app around the user will aid in a more appealing application.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
