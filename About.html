                    <p>
                        My name is Kalyn Mitchell and I am a current student at Boise State University pursuing a
                        Bachelor's in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies. I have spent my time at
                        University cultivating a variety of skills, including gaining experience in web development,
                        application development, and UX/UI.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As I have ventured down this path, I have developed a love for helping those in need of my
                        services. I have created applications aimed to help the greater good, and strive to continue to
                        do so throughout my professional carreer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My want to help others can be seen throughout many of my projects. My most recent project
                        completed was a prototype of an application aimed to help the students at Boise State University
                        find available parking. One of my current projects is a virtual reality game that helps dog
                        owners, specifically owners of reactive dogs, learn how to properly read their body language and
                        gain confidence in their training.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently looking for an internship to gain industry experience.
